# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. It is implemented using TensorFlow and a 
linear classifier. The model is trained on a dataset containing passenger information such as age, sex, class, fare, and other relevant features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from the Titanic dataset available on TensorFlow Datasets. It consists of a training set and 
an evaluation set.

## Project Structure

The project's code is organized as follows:

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset files.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing an overview of the project.

## Requirements

To run the project code, the following dependencies are required:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
